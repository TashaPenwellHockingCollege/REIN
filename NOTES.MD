# Golden Formula
 * 70% of the ARV (After Review Value) - Repairs = Offer
 * ARV = what would property be worth once repairs are done
 * i.e. if ARV is $100,000 then ARV is $70,000
        70,000 - 10,000 for repairs = $60,000
        $60,000 is the offer

## to find the ARV
  * find compariable homes in the area and see what they are selling for per sq foot
